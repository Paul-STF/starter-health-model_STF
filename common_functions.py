"""Common Functions
This file contains some common functions that are used within
the other scripts in this repo.

Note: The functions that pull the data from Augur are always separate
from the functions that graph the data so that you could choose to 
collect the data and use another tool to generate the graphs and
display the data. The data collection functions have names ending
in '_data' while graphing functions have names ending in '_graph'
